1. Type make into the command line to compile newalg123.c as an executable called project1
2. Run the executable project1 to start the program
3. Algorithms 1 through 4 will read in MSS_Problems.txt and output to MSS_Results.txt
4. After step 3 is done, press the enter key to run all 4 algorithms for the experimental analysis. This consists of 10 randomly generated arrays for each input size that we have provided.
5. The running time and size of array tested are displayed and the program will end when the last array for linear test is completed.
